1- Git(VCS) is a version control system. i will store every version of chagnes which you are changing in your code or files. means when ever i modify anything i becomes new version nad we can go back on any version .

Git commands:

###note: after git init you should have configure the git in your system.
git config --global user.name "surya"

- Git reposirtoty is folder where is .git is stote.

11- git clone: to copy the git repo from github to your local system


## Git Ftech vs Git Pull

- Git Fetch: it will pick the only new chnages in your repo to your local repo only not in your working directory means it will only show the changes in your branch but not merge it in your local branch . to apply the changes in your local wokr dir you have to merge it.

- Git Pull : git fetch + git pull

Git pull will pick the fresh chnages from remote repo and apply in your workdir. this will apply only the current branch.
